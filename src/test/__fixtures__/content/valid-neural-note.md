# Valid Neural Note Content

This is a test neural note with some content. It has multiple paragraphs to test reading time calculation.

## Section 1

Here is some content in the first section. This paragraph has enough words to contribute to the reading time calculation. We want to make sure the word count is accurate.

## Section 2

Another section with more content. Testing the markdown parsing capabilities.

### Code Example

```typescript
function example() {
  return "This is a code block";
}
```

The code block above should be handled correctly by the parser.

## Conclusion

This is the conclusion of the test neural note. It should parse correctly and extract all frontmatter fields.
