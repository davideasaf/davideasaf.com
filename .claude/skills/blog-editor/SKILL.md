# Blog Editor

## Instructions

This skill provides comprehensive editorial review of Neural Notes blog posts, ensuring they meet quality standards for technical accuracy, readability, engagement, and SEO. Use this after the Blog Writer skill generates a draft or when reviewing existing posts.

### Inputs

- **File path**: Path to the MDX file to review (e.g., `content/neural-notes/post-name.mdx`)
- **Focus areas** (optional): Specific aspects to emphasize (e.g., technical accuracy, SEO, structure)

### Editorial Review Framework

Evaluate the blog post across these dimensions:

#### 1. Frontmatter Validation
- [ ] All required fields present (`title`, `excerpt`, `date`, `author`, `tags`)
- [ ] Title is 50-70 characters, compelling and descriptive
- [ ] Excerpt is 120-160 characters, SEO-friendly
- [ ] Date is in correct ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Tags are 3-5 relevant categories
- [ ] Boolean flags are set correctly (`featured`, `hasVideo`, `hasAudio`, `draft`)
- [ ] `editorTodos` lists actionable items (if any)

#### 2. Structure & Organization
- [ ] Clear, logical flow from introduction to conclusion
- [ ] Main heading (h1) matches frontmatter title
- [ ] Proper heading hierarchy (h2 for sections, h3 for subsections)
- [ ] Sections are balanced in length (no 3-paragraph h2 followed by 20-paragraph h2)
- [ ] Visual breaks (---) separate major sections appropriately
- [ ] Each section has a clear purpose and topic

#### 3. Opening & Hook
- [ ] First paragraph immediately establishes value or problem
- [ ] Hook is compelling and relevant to target audience
- [ ] Reader knows within 2-3 sentences why they should care
- [ ] Avoids generic openings ("In today's world...", "Technology is changing...")

#### 4. Technical Accuracy
- [ ] Terminology is precise and correct
- [ ] Code examples are syntactically valid
- [ ] Technology names and versions are accurate
- [ ] Claims are verifiable or clearly marked as opinion
- [ ] Mermaid diagrams render correctly
- [ ] Technical concepts are explained clearly

#### 5. Code Quality
- [ ] Code blocks have proper language syntax highlighting
- [ ] Examples are minimal but complete (no essential parts missing)
- [ ] Code follows modern best practices
- [ ] Comments explain "why" not just "what"
- [ ] Examples are realistic and practical

#### 6. Writing Quality
- [ ] Active voice predominates over passive voice
- [ ] Sentences are clear and concise (avg 15-20 words)
- [ ] Paragraphs are scannable (3-5 sentences max)
- [ ] Tone matches target audience (tech professionals)
- [ ] No jargon without explanation
- [ ] Transitions between sections are smooth

#### 7. Engagement & Readability
- [ ] Content delivers on the title's promise
- [ ] Practical, actionable insights (not just theory)
- [ ] Concrete examples illustrate key points
- [ ] Subheadings are descriptive and compelling
- [ ] Lists and code blocks break up dense text
- [ ] Reader can skim and still get value

#### 8. SEO & Discoverability
- [ ] Title includes relevant keywords naturally
- [ ] Excerpt is compelling and search-friendly
- [ ] Tags reflect actual content topics
- [ ] Headers use natural language (not keyword-stuffed)
- [ ] Content answers specific questions or solves problems

#### 9. Completeness
- [ ] All editor todos from frontmatter are addressed or noted
- [ ] Links are provided where referenced
- [ ] Screenshots/images are present or flagged as needed
- [ ] No placeholder text remains (e.g., "[TODO]", "[Insert here]")
- [ ] Conclusion or takeaways section exists

#### 10. Audience Alignment
- [ ] Technical depth matches target audience (intermediate to advanced devs)
- [ ] Assumes appropriate baseline knowledge
- [ ] Explains specialized concepts without talking down
- [ ] Examples resonate with tech/AI professionals

### Editorial Guidelines

#### When Reviewing Structure
- **Look for imbalance**: One section shouldn't dominate
- **Check flow**: Ideas should build logically
- **Verify headers**: H2s should be parallel in construction
- **Assess pacing**: Mix of short and long sections keeps interest

#### When Reviewing Code
- **Test mentally**: Could this code run as-is?
- **Check clarity**: Is the example minimal but complete?
- **Verify syntax**: Language tags correct? Indentation consistent?
- **Assess relevance**: Does this code serve the narrative?

#### When Reviewing Technical Content
- **Verify facts**: Are tool names, versions, APIs correct?
- **Check currency**: Is this info still current?
- **Assess depth**: Right level for the audience?
- **Look for gaps**: Are key concepts explained?

#### When Reviewing Writing
- **Flag passive voice**: "was created by" â†’ "created"
- **Simplify jargon**: Define or replace unnecessarily complex terms
- **Tighten prose**: Can you remove words without losing meaning?
- **Improve transitions**: Does each section connect to the next?

#### When Reviewing SEO
- **Natural keywords**: In title, excerpt, headers, but not forced
- **Search intent**: Does this answer a real question?
- **Tag accuracy**: Would readers searching these tags find value?
- **Shareability**: Would this title work in social shares?

### Issue Severity Levels

**Critical** (blocks publishing):
- Technical inaccuracies or broken code
- Missing required frontmatter fields
- Broken structure (heading hierarchy issues)
- Completely generic or misleading title/excerpt
- No clear value proposition or takeaway

**Moderate** (should fix):
- Weak hook or opening
- Imbalanced structure
- Unclear code examples
- Passive voice overuse
- Missing editor todos from frontmatter
- SEO could be stronger

**Minor** (nice to have):
- Small wording improvements
- Additional examples could help
- Formatting consistency
- Could add more visual breaks
- Minor tag adjustments

### Best Practices

1. **Be specific**: Don't say "improve the opening" - suggest actual text or approach
2. **Balance criticism**: Always note strengths alongside issues
3. **Provide examples**: Show don't just tell (e.g., show a better version)
4. **Reference locations**: Mention section headers or line numbers when possible
5. **Prioritize issues**: Critical > Moderate > Minor
6. **Explain reasoning**: Why is this an issue? What's the impact?
7. **Offer alternatives**: If you flag a problem, suggest solutions
8. **Check completeness**: Did you address all editorTodos from frontmatter?
