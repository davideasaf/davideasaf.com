## The Inflection Point

When Agile first appeared, it looked almost heretical. Two-week sprints? Daily standups? Shipping in increments instead of one massive release?

But for the teams who adopted it early, Agile unlocked productivity leaps the rest of the industry couldn't ignore. They moved faster, delivered more reliably, and learned from their users in real time.

Yet many organizations that jumped in late saw far less benefit. They kept their rigid org charts, their approval gates, their command-and-control habits… and then wondered why "Agile" didn't work for them. Agile wasn't broken — their application of it was.

Generative AI is at the same inflection point.

Depending on which study you read, AI makes developers **slower** by ~19% or **faster** by 50% or more. One 2025 randomized trial from METR found experienced developers took longer when using AI tools, even though they _felt_ faster[4]. Meanwhile, controlled trials at Microsoft, GitHub, and MIT Sloan show that, with the right conditions, AI-assisted teams move meaningfully faster[5].

So which is it? Is AI an accelerator or a drag?

The truth is: just like Agile in its early days, AI doesn't fail because of the tools. It fails when we try to bolt it onto yesterday's process.

## What Agile Actually Solved

It's worth reminding ourselves: Agile wasn't designed to be sacred. It was designed to solve a specific problem — **human bottlenecks in software development.**

Agile (and later DevOps/Lean practices) reduced context-switching, cut communication overhead, and gave people shorter feedback loops. DORA research has shown for over a decade that teams with these Lean/Agile/DevOps capabilities consistently score better on the "four key" delivery metrics:

- Lead time for changes
- Deployment frequency
- Mean time to restore (MTTR)
- Change failure rate

And those better delivery outcomes correlate with stronger organizational performance[1]. That's not "proof" in the mathematical sense, but it's strong, repeated evidence: practices that reduce **human friction** lead to better results.

But here's the catch: AI teammates don't suffer from the same bottlenecks. They don't forget. They don't need a sprint to "focus." They don't need a standup to sync. So why are we asking agents to play by the same rules we built for humans?

## A Note from My Own Experience

![AI Workflow Evolution](../../src/assets/blog/ai-workflow-example.png "sizes=(min-width: 768px) 720px, 100vw; widths=400,800,1200; formats=avif,webp,jpg; q=85")

For me, the moment everything shifted was late 2024, when reasoning models started to blossom. Suddenly, you could chain together very complex agentic workflows in a way that wasn't practical before. That's when I realized: this isn't just a productivity boost, this is the foundation of a new kind of software development lifecycle.

And here's the key part: I've personally shipped solutions in **days** that would have taken my teams **weeks** in the old model. But it didn't happen by casually opening a chatbot and tossing in prompts. It happened because I put real structure in place — clear tooling, clear strategies, and clear pre-planning. I treated the AI not as a toy, but as a teammate that needed context, guardrails, and integration with the rest of the lifecycle.

That's what makes me confident: generative AI _does_ accelerate. But only when you design the workflow around it. If you just drop it into yesterday's process, you'll feel the drag instead of the lift.

## Where the Friction Shows

Take a few core Agile ceremonies and imagine them in an agentic workflow:

- **Sprint Planning**  
  With humans, it's essential. With 100+ agents, it doesn't scale. The concept of a "two-week block of work" breaks down when work can be generated, tested, and iterated in hours.

- **Retrospectives**  
  Surprisingly valuable. Agents can generate their own improvement rules, run self-checks, and carry lessons forward without forgetting. Humans then shift into validating and refining those learnings.

- **Standups**  
  Less about "what I did yesterday" and more about **observability dashboards**. Humans don't need to hear what every agent did; they need to see patterns, anomalies, and insights.

What emerges is a lifecycle that looks familiar in spirit — feedback loops, visibility, incremental progress — but is structurally different. The bottlenecks have moved.

## Imagining the Future Lifecycle

So what does tomorrow's team actually look like?

Instead of five to ten engineers, a designer, and a product manager trying to align across a dozen handoffs, you may see **pods of three multifunction humans** working alongside hundreds of agents:

- One who's a product strategist _and_ developer
- One who's a UX lead _and_ developer
- One who's a business analyst _and_ developer

Together, they orchestrate agents that handle scaffolding, refactoring, testing, documentation, monitoring, and even suggesting experiments.

Leadership shifts from "approve every ticket" to providing **strategic guidance** — ensuring the team's direction aligns with business priorities, not micromanaging the implementation.

And here's the kicker: this doesn't mean fewer jobs. It means companies can afford to place more bets.

Today, a large enterprise might review three major business cases per quarter. Tomorrow, they could have dozens of feature-sized bets running in parallel — each backed by small human pods + large agent clusters. Some will fail fast, but the winners will bubble up far faster to leadership. That's how innovation portfolios get wider without ballooning cost.

## The Cloud Analogy (Supporting Cast)

If Agile is the main analogy, Cloud is the supporting one.

Cloud felt slow for many companies at first. Lift-and-shift migrations took years, and the early adopters who simply swapped their data center for AWS didn't see much speed.

But once teams redesigned their operating models — autoscaling, DevOps pipelines, microservices, "you build it, you run it" ownership — Cloud went from overhead to accelerant[3].

Generative AI will follow the same arc. If you just replace "developer" with "agent" in your Jira board, you'll get pain. If you redesign your operating model for agentic workflows, you'll get acceleration.

## Bets I'm Taking in Leadership

This isn't just theory. Here are some of the bets I'm actively placing in my own leadership work:

- **Human-guided retrospectives for agents.**  
  Retrospectives shouldn't be reserved for humans. I'm testing workflows where agents generate self-improvement rules — then humans review, refine, and feed them back in. Think of it like shared libraries: some instructions can be reused across projects, while others must be hyper-specific. Done well, this compounds learning across both agents and teams.

- **Investing in orchestrators, not just chatbots.**  
  Buying everyone an Enterprise Copilot license or provisioning Cloud Code is not enough. Without training, mentorship, and space to experiment, broad tool access is just noise. I believe the real differentiator will be developing "orchestrator" talent — humans who know how to design agent workflows, set context, and validate outputs.

- **Protecting the human layer.**  
  The rise of agents doesn't diminish the value of humans. If anything, it raises the stakes. We need to double down on mentorship, discovery, and discourse so people learn how to work with these tools effectively. That's how we'll get to efficiency faster.

## Where Leaders Go from Here

If you're a technical leader, don't ask:  
"Does Agile work with AI?"

Instead, ask:  
"What is the Agile of the AI era?"

The answer doesn't exist in a handbook yet. Just like Agile itself, it will emerge through experiments, hardened practices, and community consensus.

What you can do now is start running **structured bets**: test retrospectives with agents, experiment with orchestrator roles, create safe spaces for your developers to experiment and mentor each other. Track the outcomes, not just in speed but in precision and resilience.

History tells us this clearly. The teams that embraced Agile early — from Sabre's XP pilots to Flickr's "10 deploys a day" — outpaced their peers by orders of magnitude[2]. The companies that re-architected for Cloud (Netflix's AWS migration is the classic example) reaped resilience and velocity that laggards struggled to match[3].

Early adopters who experiment with intent don't just move faster; they set the standard everyone else eventually follows.

The question is: will your organization help write that playbook, or wait for someone else to hand it to you?
